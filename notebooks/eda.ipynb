    "#### Emcee Career Survival Analysis: Documented Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining \"Career Start\" and \"Career Length\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- A career starts at the date of an emcee's first recorded battle (`first_battle`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Career length is measured in months, computed as:\n",
    "    `(last_battle.year - first_battle.year) * 12 + (last_battle.month - first_battle.month)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gap Statistics Between Battles\n",
    "\n",
    "For each emcee, the following statistics are computed:\n",
    "- `median_gap_months`: median time between consecutive battles\n",
    "- `mean_gap_months`: average time between battles\n",
    "- `stdev_gap_months`: standard deviation of gap durations\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaps are measured in months, not days.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Defining Inactivity\n",
    "\n",
    "An emcee is considered inactive if:\n",
    "- Time since their last battle exceeds their `median_gap_months` plus a buffer of 6 months.\n",
    "- If the emcee has only 1 battle, or their median gap is zero or missing, the fallback threshold is 24 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit thresholds used:\n",
    "- `fallback_months` = 24\n",
    "- `buffer_months` = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "- `inactivity_threshold_months = median_gap_months + buffer_months`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Emcee Status Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Each emcee is assigned a status string for richer diagnostic context:\n",
    "- `active`: More than one battle and last battle was recent\n",
    "- `inactive`: More than one battle and last battle was too long ago\n",
    "- `single-battle-active`: Only one battle, but still recent\n",
    "- `single-battle-inactive`: Only one battle, and too long ago\n",
    "- `unknown`: Missing or malformed battle date information\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a binary inactive column is defined as 1 or 0 based on the threshold logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Pandemic-Aware Buffering\n",
    "- The choice of `fallback_months` = 24 is intentionally generous to account for disruption in recorded battles during the COVID-19 pandemic (approximately 2020–2023).\n",
    "- This helps avoid misclassifying emcees as inactive if their last battle occurred just before or during the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Survival Analysis Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- An emcee is considered to have had a career-ending event if their status is either `inactive` or `single-battle-inactive`.\n",
    "- Emcees with other statuses (`active`, `single-battle-active`, `unknown`) are treated as right-censored in the Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n",
    "- The survival curve shows the probability that an emcee remains active (not yet inactive) over time in months since their first battle.\n",
    "- A median survival time of 29 months means that half of emcees remain active at least 29 months into their career."
